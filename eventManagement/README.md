# About

First application developed during my React Native Ignite journey.
You are initially prompted to input your Event's name, then it takes you to enter the participants.

- There are validations to prevent entering duplicated participants or a blank participants's name .
- You are prompted to an alert message for you to confirm deleting whenever you try to remove a participant. 

# Motivation

Understand and practice React Native Fundamentals.
Keep committed with my goals.
Interact with the Dev Community, learn together and progress as a Developer.</br>
